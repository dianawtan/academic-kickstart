abstract: The summarized studies indicate an increased frequency of minor facial anomalies in individuals with ASC compared to TD individuals [Ozgen et al., 2011, 2013; Rodier et al., 1997; Walker, 1977]. Among the features examined, facial asymmetry in ASC appears to exhibit the greatest consistency between studies [Hammond et al., 2008; Ozgen et al., 2011, 2013]. There is also some evidence to suggest that ASC-related facial characteristics may correspond with particular cognitive and behavioral traits. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, reduced maxillary height and increased mouth width may be more common among individuals with ASC who have comorbid intellectual disability, language regression, and greater severity of ASC symptoms [Aldridge et al., 2011; Obafemi-Ajayi et al., 2015]. Findings from one study suggest that decreased mouth width may be more common among individuals with ASC who have an IQ within the normal range and lower symptom severity [Obafemi-Ajayi et al., 2015]. However, these conclusions must be considered preliminary given that the studies in this area have overlapping participant samples.
