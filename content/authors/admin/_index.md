Diana Tan is a postdoctoral researcher in psychology at the University of Western Australia (UWA) and Telethon Kids Institute. In 2012, she uprooted from Singapore to Perth, Western Australia to pursue her Honours and PhD degrees in UWA. Her research aims to understand biological mechanisms underlying the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and to identify early markers that contribute to the developmental cascade leading to a diagnosis of ASD. She is also passionate about doing and sharing good science!
